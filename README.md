## Apel & Banini: A Non-Profit Mission

**Apel & Banini** is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting ethical, open-source technology and decentralized digital infrastructure. Our flagship project, the **Capsule Toy Machine**, is an open-source home server project designed to provide long-lasting and sustainable WebXR experiences. The Capsule Toy Machine allows developers and users to serve and share immersive XR content in a fully offline environment, leveraging **ePub packaging** to distribute WebXR applications.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to build a platform where developers and users alike can **create**, **share**, and **experience** XR content without reliance on proprietary cloud services or centralized corporate infrastructure. Apel & Banini believes in the importance of:
- **Longevity**: Ensuring that XR applications created today remain accessible for decades.
- **Offline Access**: Enabling the use of WebXR applications in offline environments, supporting local WiFi networks for up to 100 users.
- **Open-Source**: Offering developers and hobbyists the tools they need to build and share XR content freely.
- **Decentralization**: Empowering individuals to host and distribute their own content, avoiding reliance on centralized servers.

## What is the Capsule Toy Machine?

The **Capsule Toy Machine** is a home server designed to serve WebXR applications packaged as **ePub files**. These applications can be distributed physically on SD cards or shared digitally. This device allows users to experience and interact with immersive XR environments in a fully decentralized and offline manner, making it a unique platform for both hobbyists and developers.

### Key Features:
- **Offline-First**: Up to 100 users can connect via local WiFi without needing an internet connection.
- **Long-Term Sustainability**: Content packaged as ePub files can be accessed for decades without dependence on corporate servers.
- **Open-Source APIs**: Includes powerful open-source APIs for multiplayer, content sharing, voice/video chat, and more.
- **Local Server**: The device unpacks ePub files and hosts them locally, providing an immersive XR experience to users within a local network.
